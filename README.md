Welcome! This is the official repo for AL-QASIDA (Robinson et al., 2025), 
the first comprehensive evaluation for LLM dialectal Arabic proficiency, presented in 
this paper: 
[AL-QASIDA: **A**nalyzing **L**LM **Q**uality and **A**ccuracy **S**ystematically **i**n **D**ialectal **A**rabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04193)

## Instructions

To set up the environment, run:

```
bash setup.sh
```

For instructions on running AL-QASIDA, refer to 

1. [`data_processing/README.md`](data_processing/README.md)
2. [`eval/README.md`](eval/README.md)
3. [`humevals/README.md`](humevals/README.md)

in that order. 

You could also skip to step #3 if you don't want to run AL-QASIDA on your own model. 
The results for the models we evaluated in our paper are already in `llm_outputs`.
