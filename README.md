## Instructions

To set up the environment, run:

```
bash setup.sh
```

For instructions on running AL-QASIDA, refer to 

1. [`data_processing/README.md`](data_processing/README.md)
2. [`eval/README.md`](eval/README.md)
3. [`humevals/README.md`](humevals/README.md)

in that order. 

You could also skip to step #3 if you don't want to run AL-QASIDA on your own model. 
The results for the models we evaluated in our paper are already in `llm_outputs`.
